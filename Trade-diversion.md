## Summary

US imports from China are decreasing in 2019 due to tariffs, and in 2020
due to novel coronavirus. If trade diversion is goin on, other countries
are replacing China. In this study, I somewhat arbitrarily choose 4
candidate countries like Vietnam, Korea, Japan and Mexico, and check
whether the US imports from these countries increase by HS 4 digit
codes.

## Libraries and functions

I use self-made package `tqr`.

## Download data

I download US monthly imports from China, Vietnam, Korea, Japan and
Mexico by HS 4 digit codes since 2017, convert to quartely, and fill 0s
in gaps.

## Choose HS codes of which imports from China declined significantly in 2020 2Q

I first choose HS codes of which imports from China declined by more
than 200 million dollars in 2020 2Q from a year ago. Next I choose HS
codes of which imports from China are still more than 500 million
dollars in 2020 2Q.

## Draw charts of US import changes from 2018 Q1 from each country

For the goods descriptions of HS codes, refer to
<http://www.kanzei.or.jp/statistical/expstatis/headline/hs2dig/e/85>.

Most notable case is that Vietnam replaces China as a main export base
of 8517 (telephone sets), probably smart phones. Smart phones are not
yet imposed tariffs by the US. This replacement is caused by Samsungâ€™s
strategy to expand smart phone production capacity in Vietnam, and by
ZTE and Huawei losing shares in the US.

Vietnam is also advancing in 9401 (Seats) and 9403 (Other furniture).

South Korea supplants China in 8523 (Recording medium).

No winners in 8708 (Auto parts).
